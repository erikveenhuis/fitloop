# üöÄ Deployment Guide - FitLoop

## Quick Deploy Options

### Option 1: Railway (Recommended for Full-Stack)

Railway is perfect for your app because it handles both frontend and backend together.

#### Step-by-Step:

1. **Create Railway Account**
   - Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
   - Sign up with GitHub

2. **Push to GitHub**
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/fitloop.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

3. **Create New Project on Railway**
   - Click "New Project"
   - Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
   - Choose your `fitloop` repository
   - Railway will auto-detect it's a Node.js app

4. **Configure Environment Variables**
   - In Railway dashboard, go to your project
   - Click "Variables" tab
   - Add: `VITE_REPLICATE_API_KEY` with your Replicate API key
   - Railway will auto-restart

5. **Get Your URL**
   - Railway generates a URL like: `fitloop-production.up.railway.app`
   - Click "Generate Domain" if not auto-generated
   - Your app is live! üéâ

#### Automatic Deployments
- Every `git push` to `main` will auto-deploy
- Build status shows in Railway dashboard
- Rollback available if needed

### Option 2: Vercel (Frontend) + Railway (Backend)

Split deployment for better optimization.

#### Backend (Railway):
1. Create new Railway project
2. Deploy from GitHub
3. Add environment variable: `VITE_REPLICATE_API_KEY`
4. Note your backend URL: `https://your-app.up.railway.app`

#### Frontend (Vercel):
1. **Install Vercel CLI**
   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

2. **Update API URL**
   - Edit `src/services/tryonAPI.js`
   - Change `http://localhost:3001/api` to your Railway backend URL

3. **Deploy to Vercel**
   ```bash
   vercel
   ```
   
4. **Auto-Deploy Setup**
   - Connect GitHub repo in Vercel dashboard
   - Every push to `main` auto-deploys

### Option 3: Render (Free Tier Available)

#### Step-by-Step:

1. **Create Render Account**
   - Go to [render.com](https://render.com)
   - Sign up with GitHub

2. **Create Web Service**
   - Click "New +"
   - Select "Web Service"
   - Connect your GitHub repo

3. **Configure Build**
   - **Name**: fitloop
   - **Environment**: Node
   - **Build Command**: `npm install && npm run build`
   - **Start Command**: `npm run start`
   - **Plan**: Free

4. **Environment Variables**
   - Add `VITE_REPLICATE_API_KEY`
   - Your Replicate API key

5. **Deploy**

## üí∞ Cost Estimates

### Railway
- **Free tier**: $5 credit/month
- **Pro**: $20/month (includes $20 usage)
- Your app: ~$5-10/month estimated

### Vercel
- **Hobby**: Free forever
- **Pro**: $20/month (if needed)

### Render
- **Free**: Limited (sleeps after 15min inactivity)
- **Starter**: $7/month (always on)

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Build Fails
- Check Node.js version (use 18 or 20)
- Verify all dependencies installed
- Check build logs for errors

### App Not Starting
- Ensure `npm run start` works locally
- Check environment variables set
- Verify port configuration (Railway auto-assigns)

### API Errors
- Confirm `VITE_REPLICATE_API_KEY` is set
- Check backend URL is correct
- Verify CORS settings

### Camera Not Working
- Ensure HTTPS is enabled (Railway/Vercel do this automatically)
- Check browser permissions
- Test on different browsers

---

## üì± Mobile Considerations

Your app works on mobile, but:
- Camera needs HTTPS (production has this)
- Portrait mode works best
- Test on actual devices
- Consider PWA for app-like experience

---

## üöÄ Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Deploy to Railway (after setup)
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy to production"
git push

# Deploy to Vercel
vercel --prod

# Check deployment status
railway status

# View logs
railway logs

# Rollback (if needed)
railway rollback
```
